In this project we hav to analyze weather we have promoted the valid employees or not.
As we the company has setteled some paramaters on the basis of which we have analyze weather the employees promoted are promoted on the bbasis of the paramaters setteled by the company
Company has provided us the dataset you will found it on the link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rQyHrzyX7HvDJokiiQyNkEULFufkG-1v/view?usp=sharing).
We have to see the parameters :  i). Employees is recruited from the credible source.
                                ii). Employee's previous record should be good.   
                               iii). Employee's score should be above 60% in the training.
                                iv). Employees's KPI>80% Key Performance Indicator should be above 80% but , in case if the training score of the employee is above 60% and , the score of KPI is not above 80% then , employee should be considereed.                                 
The dataset provided by the company is pretty much cleaned but, then also we have cleaned it on our understanding.
Then , I have staeted the Data Cleaning part, after importing important libraries (Numpy , Pandas  , Matplotlib , Seaborn).
Then, I have staeted the Bivarate analysis of the data as , I checked all the columns and checked their correlations with the Target variable.
It is also showing that , columns which are having good correlations with the Target Column are the one on which , company have setteled the promotions parameters.
At the end COLCLUSION: 
1. We can promote the employees which are newely entered in our MNC .
2. Freshers with only of 1 year or less that 1 year experience are very talented one's if any of the parameter on which we have decided the promotions is successful then , we can promote those employees
3. Mostly Bachelor's degree employees are here in our company
4. Expericene with the less then 10 years of expericnce are promoted in bulk.
5. We can also promote the younger employees for growth in our company without consedering the all the any of 1 parameters parameter for promotion is valid .
6. I think the employees who have the previous_avg_rating above 3 with awards_won have to be promoted without consedering the KPIs_met >80% promote those employees
7. Techncology , Procuerment , Analytical department are most progressive departments of the company , they have to be promoted rapidly for growth of the company very easily .
8. No need to accelerate the promotions in Sales & Marketing they , are going at good pace.
9. Employees came from the sourcing recruitment_channel are performing well in the company , it means they are skilled and source is trusted.
